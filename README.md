# GAN for fashion-MNIST, with FID
Attached is a basic GAN, referenced to "MNIST FASION".

Since the discriminator also improves during training, I needed an *external tool* to evaluate the improvement of the genreted images.

To do this I used FID.

Following are few pictures to illustrate the training progress.

This GAN suffers from mode-collapse. 

By using an *Unrolled GAN*, we can prevent the generator from optimizing for a single fixed discriminator, since the loss function incorporates not only the current discriminator's classifications, but also future discriminator versions.

So the generator can't over-optimize for a single discriminator.

Following is the FID graph: (Sorry for not finding the graph with 20 epochs)
